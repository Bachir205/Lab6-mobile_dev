# Lab 6 — Tic-Tac-Toe in React Native

Follow the official React tutorial, **[Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)**, from **Overview** to **Wrapping up**, and build the game as a **React Native** application.

The tutorial explains every React idea; this page only lists what changes on a phone.

**One rule:** keep the tutorial's names — `Square`, `Board`, `Game`, `onSquareClick`, `handleClick`, `calculateWinner`, `history`, `currentMove`, `jumpTo`, `onPlay`, `xIsNext`. Change only the building blocks.

## Setup

Skip the tutorial's **Setup** section (CodeSandbox). Instead:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest tic-tac-toe
cd tic-tac-toe
npm run reset-project
npx expo start
```

All the code goes in `src/app/index.tsx`. Open the project in Expo Go.

## Translation Table

| Tutorial (web) | React Native |
|---|---|
| `<div>` | `<View>` |
| `<button onClick={…}>` | `<Pressable onPress={…}>` |
| Text written directly inside an element | Text **must** be inside `<Text>` |
| `className="square"` + `styles.css` | `style={styles.square}` + `StyleSheet.create` |
| `<div className="board-row">` | `<View>` with `flexDirection: "row"` — the default is `column` |
| `<ol>` / `<li>` | `<ScrollView>` with one `<Pressable>` per move |
| Plain JavaScript | TypeScript: `type SquareValue = "X" \| "O" \| null;` and typed props |

## Section-by-Section Notes

| Tutorial section | What changes |
|---|---|
| Inspecting the starter code | There is no starter: write `Square` yourself, as one `Pressable` with an X inside a `Text`. Ignore `index.js`. |
| Building the board | Same Fragment error, same fix. Rows are `View`s with `flexDirection: "row"`. |
| Making an interactive component | `console.log` output appears in the Expo terminal, not in a browser console. |
| React Developer Tools | Press `j` in the Expo terminal to open React Native DevTools; the **Components** tab is the same. |
| Declaring a winner | The status is a `<Text>`. |
| Lifting state up, again | Expo Router displays the file's `export default`: moving it to `Game` is enough. |
| Showing the past moves | Place the move list **below** the board — a phone is too narrow for side by side. |


## Checkpoints

Commit when each one works:

| # | The app… | Commit message |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | shows a 3 × 3 board of `Square` components | `Board of nine squares` |
| 2 | plays a full game: turns, no overwriting, a winner | `Playable game with a winner` |
| 3 | lists the moves and jumps back in time; `xIsNext` is computed | `Time travel` |
| 4 | includes the improvements below | one commit per improvement |


## Deliverables
